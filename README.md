# Pokemon EV Trainer
A tool you can use to keep track of your Pokemon's effort values (EVs). Some features include effort value incrementation and decrementation, Chart.js visualization, Select2 dropdowns, PokeAPI integration, and local storage saving. Work in progress. You can access it through my GitHub Pages and https://xhorxhiolldashi.github.io/Pokemon-EV-Trainer/.
